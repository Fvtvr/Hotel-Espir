How fancy?
Was fancy when build around 20 years earlier, but have deteriorated a bit since even if the staff have tried to keep everything nice and clean.




Questions for Felix:
Should doors be apart of the modules, or only the door frames? -> Same question regarding stuff like curtains

What does the texturing/uv process look like? -> Is it all in blender or do you texture in Unity?
How many modules do you normally need, for this project? -> Do you have a single high res texture-set with all the different needed textures, like basic wall-texture, floor texture, doorframe texture and so on, or do you have a texture per type of module or something in between?

Do you stage in unity or blender or both?

How big should the modules be?

Is lighting done through emmisive texture or lights in engine or both?
